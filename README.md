# Voice-Recognition-Software
A voice recognition software created in Matlab from scratch using Digital Signal Processing concepts. You will need Matlab to run this.
Download the zip into your default Matlab folder, and run VoiceRecognitionHomeUI.m. Follow all the commands on the Matlab console to create a database with new voice samples (need to provide 3 samples for training the software). Then provide a new voice sample to match against the existing voice data in your database.
